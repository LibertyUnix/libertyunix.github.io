#### Below you find various pieces of python code from engagements. Please note I do not consider myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination. 

#### This code below is for educational purposes only.


#### Quick example of using the host command to determine the IP address of a target.
```python
import subprocess, string, re
process = subprocess.Popen('/usr/bin/host -a google.com', shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE);

for line in process.stdout:
    match = re.findall('A   (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', line)
    if match: print match[0]
```
### Now lets try downloading a webpage and printing the results.
```python
import urllib2
response = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.bing.com/search?q=philadelphai+flyers")
print response.read()
```
### Now lets take this set further and look through the printed results for a certain string.
```python
import urllib2,re
response = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.bing.com/search?q=fphiladelphia+flyers")
data = response.read()

matches = re.findall('Mike Vecchione', data)
for match in matches:
    print "GOT A HIT:",match
```
### What if the website you want to connect to, extact data from and parse requires authentication?
```python
import urllib2

auth_handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
auth_handler.add_password(realm='Secure Site',
                          uri='http://192.168.11.101:8080',
                          user='admin',
                          passwd='password')
opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_handler)
urllib2.install_opener(opener)

try:
    response = urllib2.urlopen('http://192.168.11.101:8080')

except urllib2.HTTPError:
    print "[!] Wrong Login or Password"

else:
    print "[*] Login is correct. Printing returned content..."
    print response.read()
```
